## Welcome

Welcome to the US Department of Agriculture snacks classification assignment!

Me and my friend Yoni, used the attached datasets to classify different kinds of snacks from the US to 6 different categories.

## Walkthrough

I highly recommend you to first take a glimpse at the EDA section.\
There you could find some interesting insights of the datasets.\
We also made up little stories to keep you entertained during your glimpse.

As soon as you finish you are more than welcome to continue to the modelling section.\
We developed 4 different models for this classification task, and used 3 of them for predicting.

In the model folder you can read the Modelling PDF that will walk you through our models' development process.

## The results

Model 1 - 94.7%\
Model 2 - 95.1%\
Model 3 - 96%
